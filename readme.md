# Project Name

## Project Description
[There is] … growing evidence that maternal mental health has long-reaching effects on the physical, intellectual, and emotional development of a woman’s children. Maternal mental health is therefore a true public health issue that ultimately affects every one of us. (National Academy of Medicine) Data gaps on both maternal outcomes and their determinants constrain crafting evidence-based policies and interventions to address the maternal health crisis in the US. A growing body of evidence has found that the environment in which mothers live, work, deliver and raise their children can increase their risk of adverse health outcomes during and beyond pregnancy.
<p>
The MVI ranks US counties and states in terms of vulnerability to poor pregnancy outcomes, offering each geography a relative maternal vulnerability score (on a scale of 0–100, where a higher score indicates greater vulnerability to adverse maternal outcomes). For this project I will be looking at the MVI scores of over 3k counties across the United States, along with county demographic data and other quality of care index scores to find out what factors and environmental conditions are driving the MVI index score. By the end of the project my goal is to provide actionable feedback and recommendations that can be used by legislative and community leaders to better the quality of care for mothers in the U.S.
