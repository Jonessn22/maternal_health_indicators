# Evaluating Indicators of Maternal Health
[There is] … growing evidence that maternal mental health has long-reaching effects on the physical, intellectual, and emotional development of a woman’s children. Maternal mental health is therefore a true public health issue that ultimately affects every one of us. (National Academy of Medicine) A growing body of evidence has found that the environment in which mothers live, work, deliver and raise their children can increase their risk of adverse health outcomes during and beyond pregnancy.

## Project Description
For this project I will be creating a model that can predict a county's Maternal Vulnerability Index (MVI) score. The MVI score ranks US counties and states in terms of vulnerability to poor pregnancy outcomes, offering each geography a relative maternal vulnerability score (on a scale of 0–100, where a higher score indicates greater vulnerability to adverse maternal outcomes). I will be looking at the MVI scores of over 3k counties across the United States, along with county demographic data and other quality of life index scores to find out what factors and environmental conditions are driving the MVI score. By the end of the project my goal is to provide actionable feedback and recommendations that can be used by legislative and community leaders to better the quality of care for mothers in the U.S.
